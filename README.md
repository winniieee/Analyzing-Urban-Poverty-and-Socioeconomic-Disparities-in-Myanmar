# Analyzing-Urban-Poverty-and-Socioeconomic-Disparities-in-Myanmar

In the project "Exploring Myanmar's Fight Against Urban Poverty," I utilized two softwares for spatial and statistical analysis; ArcGIS Pro for geospatial analysis and Rstudio for data processing and analysis. This endeavor held personal significance as I was born and raised in Myanmar, which fueled my dedication to investigating the country's socioeconomic challenges, especially within urban areas, amid political upheaval and the COVID-19 pandemic. This project underscored the multifaceted challenges Myanmar faces in its battle against urban poverty and highlighted the importance of collective action and social unity in addressing these issues. This project not only served as a demonstration of technical skills but also as a means to contribute meaningfully to addressing the complex challenges facing Myanmar, a country I hold close to my heart due to my upbringing and personal connection.


The analysis includes a map illustrating Poverty Rates in Myanmar, underscoring the relatively low levels of poverty in Yangon, a bustling metropolitan center. In 2020, Yangon was poised for significant urbanization and geospatial transformations, driven by a surge in construction and foreign investment.

While the poverty rates may seem modest at first glance, a closer examination reveals a critical concern. The 13% poverty rate in Yangon translates to a staggering 700,000 individuals grappling with insufficient access to fundamental necessities like food, clothing, and shelter, a pressing issue within a population of 5,332,000 residents. Furthermore, this issue demonstrates a concerning trend as poverty extends its reach beyond the city, warranting comprehensive attention and action.

The provided bar chart illustrates the vulnerability to displacement across various states in Myanmar during the year 2022. Notably, Yangon stands out as the region experiencing the most severe consequences in terms of displacement. This phenomenon can be attributed to heightened military control exercised in urban areas with substantial populations, where the potential for influencing political dynamics and social structures is significant.

The analysis revealed a significant trend in COVID-19-related deaths, as illustrated in the chart. Initially, the total deaths followed an upward trajectory from 2020 but subsequently stabilized during the first half of 2021. However, a dramatic and conspicuous spike in the graph emerged thereafter, which can be attributed solely to the military intervention and concurrent limitations in hospitalization capacity. This observation underscores a pronounced correlation between the two variables, unequivocally linked by the total rate of COVID-19-related deaths.
